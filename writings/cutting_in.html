we live at the bottom of an ocean<br>
and it was pouring<br>
<br>
spilling &amp; staining<br>
<br>
everywhere spilled all across the deck<br>
was pouring<br>
<br>
<br>
it took three men to carry your heart away<br>
and when they sliced it through<br>
i thought it would drown us all-<br>
<br>
you wouldn't stop coming<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
i was there <br>
to open a door for you<br>
<br>
to remind you<br>
before you slipped<br>
<br>
away to wear your <br>
rain boots <br>
