        i am down on my knees<br>
i have been tying my shoes for years<br>
and i cannot rise until i am finished<br>
<br>
my hands begin to tremble each time i am almost close<br>
but when i look up to apologize<br>
your eyes are still understanding<br>
<br>
you've always had steady eyes<br>
you place your hand upon my shoulder<br>
<br>
you've always had steady hands<br>
<br>
<br>
i hate your legs<br>
those great muscles that have never crumpled beneath you or have ever failed to rise<br>
<br>
i am ashamed i could even think such a thing
