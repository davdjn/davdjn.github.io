        I have been waking early mornings<br>
in the cold with emerson;<br>
watching faces coming<br>
through the doors,<br>
our delicate hearts quickening<br>
at each pair of<br>
foreign eyes<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm quite sure he would have understood<br>
had he seen you that night<br>
reading hemingway in the <br>
library, when he was<br>
so lost and<br>
hemingway was so beautiful
