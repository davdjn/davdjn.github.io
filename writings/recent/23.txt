if and when I have given up everything that is good
and replaced it with what is now and busy
will it take more than me to find the footing again?

is it more like steps or wheels down the slope,
or, is it holding a flame to the alloy until the gold extricates itself?

-

real disquiet, with its human form and self being, 
i find to be more dangerous than the mediated distractions which I had 
before fled to from difficulty. 

with it, 
the empty breath may fall so faint upon the skin that one may live
a life without it ever feeling 
there, or out of place. 

-

I was told that,
I was sold that twenty three was a time for joyousness,
and so I came in with my open collared shirt 
to find cold death in leaves upon the wet black ground;
preternaturally hollow

-

nothing else passes now
by the door but
the postman bringing packages,
little things from the outside to adorn and decorate.

and that now is all I have too,
small devices to communicate from this place to another
provide something to you from afar
in words spoken or written down

-

this is not easy but neither is it hard
days lived understanding concrete walls 
and steel difference
days lived not close but not far, adjacent but unfamiliar, 
in the hotel with trustful strangers.

-

I feel
that this is the when 
things become used 
and child-ness slips away

-

there was I explaining leaving as if to a viewer
like stones thrown directly into the eyes,
harshness when you want to give in
happiness like you want to keep going

and when given the choice between 'force' and 'object', 
he chose force to keep going and I
chose object to give in -  to sink into a place deep enough to un-move me
cold and dark and sweet 
with un-nerving hope and heartbeat unified,
waiting for that something to happen 

-

life, unreasonable as it is,
not doing any favors for itself 

-

and now it is
cold inside, like this was my first one
death seeping unto the everyday in melodies distance I am
listening to the woman's words about something I was never owed
when I want so much from everything so desperately

-

I am afraid that I have lost something,
forgotten, precisely, maybe an important part of myself, 
like something fleeting which cannot be re-obtained,
due to time, abuse, etc.
