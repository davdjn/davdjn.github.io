A sudden fear struck me
in the dim of evening
a realization that
this place around me is decrepit
those around me deficient

then I was filled with a great despair

I followed not the lord
but a fool for a shephard

some became great in light of the greatness they saw
and they became great but
some became great in light of the ruin and waste they say
and they too became great
