beloved come near to me

you are like a desert spring in 
this world of broken things, of ash and dust and sand

your beauty is shaded from the sun and stars
I drink from it alone and live

you are the mother of my firstborn
I look upon you alone and see

_how can I know every feature of you?_

before you
I knew not love
nor misery
niether laughter 
nor silence
not tenderness 
nor strength
nor comfort
nor forgetfulness

who knows which voices will survive the passage of time?

and which whispers faint echoes will fall to men's ears for repeating?

and how many toiled volumes have been cast into the flames unread?

is it the chance of it all, the fortune's wheel, or the clear light of providence guiding?

for to each who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. but from each who has not, even what he has will be taken away.

there I stood by the side of the road, having found myself having, but without anyone to share the burden between.

in some places, the world seemed so bountiful and open
but in others - closed, dreary, and hopeless. 

the world altogether was unrecognizable from itself

A sudden fear struck me
in the dim of evening
a realization that this
place around me is decrepit
those around me second-rate

and I was filled with a great despair

And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground . . . the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

some became great in light of the greatness they saw
and thus they became great but

others became great in light of the ruin and waste they saw
and thus they too became great

but these days, there is so much to pull you away from your feelings

I felt:
the bright lights fade away
the viewer sitting alone
the show ended -
a loss-like dullness

_but only so much can come through from these:
lights, screens, sound machines_

I am scared by the 
different times of familiar places
how they look in different lights
the white ones shone in rings casting shadows
its seductive veneer in
time wore me down
