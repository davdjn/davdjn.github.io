there is alot that is happy to look upon, but there is also much which is quiet, sad, and unseen.  
the quiet things that no one ever knows. times spent alone, with too much or too little for anything to ever be reflected on the surface. 

nights when you will die and there won't be a single sound or stirring soul until the next uncoming morning.   

this is everything and everyone.

the words you read on this page are the product of another person's ongoing life. these are the things that he has seen, these are the feelings he has felt.  
he moved in his own way

what if this was death?  
no heaven, not anything else, but this Sunday morning bed,  
~~eyes full of sleep,~~ carving out this half of eternity in a semi-conscious crawl

not darkness, no good night,
only soft light through closed blinds
on un opened eyes  

un sleeping punctuated by unwaking

i had written once before that if I could write a good poem each year, than that would be enough.  
but now I am on the otherside of that poem and the otherside of this year, and I realize that nothing ever done before can be enough for the present.
