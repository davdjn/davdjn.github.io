        waiting for you is<br>
waiting for black holes to die<br>
and for all of this half of time<br>
to come to its climax<br>
<br>
but the ice melts so often in my hand, since I am still so very alive<br>
.<br>
<br>
people say bless you as I pass them on the street,<br>
because it is summer<br>
<br>
<br>
they are playing bridge when I arrive,<br>
I do not think they will play bridge with me<br>
<br>
ambitiously, I bite to the center of my apple, <br>
only to find that it is hollow;<br>
removed of all its seeds<br>
<br>
<br>
the numbers have grown too big to make a decision, <br>
<br>
and I am no tuesday morning mathematician
