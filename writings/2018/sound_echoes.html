        sound echoes so<br>
beautifully <br>
under the arch of a bridge.<br>
I stop and listen for a moment,<br>
smile at the young man and his guitar.<br>
I head to the ATM to pick up<br>
some singles;<br>
people have been asking me for them lately and<br>
I can no longer say 'sorry, have a good night' <br>
in good conscience.<br>
<br>
the bills have never been folded.<br>
I suppose it's as good a beginning as any
