        I am waiting for the judgment day<br>
<br>
I am eating the sandwich from both sides<br>
<br>
I will pursue you till your end; no longer frightened <br>
of what I will find<br>
<br>
I am stood quietly upon the overpass<br>
above those who are more<br>
pure than I<br>
<br>
<br>
someday, <br>
madness will resemble bravery
