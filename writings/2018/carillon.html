        now that we're older,<br>
moments of silence have become <br>
too far and too easy for us to bear,<br>
so sometimes we need reminding<br>
<br>
this is not for their sake, but for ours<br>
<br>
in winding belfries and weeping towers,<br>
they sing painful and deafening-<br>
clarity is born past the point of desperation,<br>
sobriety cuts beyond calm and calamity<br>
<br>
I swear we will make up our losses<br>
<br>
life becomes<br>
uninterrupted<br>
without tragedies to remind us <br>
how unnatural<br>
calm is<br>
<br>
our stillness is the deepest of puddles<br>
<br>
If this is death, I need you<br>
to be here and see this<br>
If this means anything to you, I needed you<br>
to be here and hear this<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
sometimes, we forget about that terrible<br>
transcendence<br>
found only in the<br>
tallest of <br>
towers
