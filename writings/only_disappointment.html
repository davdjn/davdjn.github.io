        only disappointment understands perfection<br>
<br>
<br>
when the shadow of the evening is hidden by the light of the midday sun<br>
<br>
and the man with the second-most<br>
<br>
quietly weeps<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
the sky was overcast<br>
<br>
the day he was born<br>
<br>
and he would never be happy.<br>
<br>
they named him taro<br>
<br>
like the root vegetable<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
some people sleep during a train ride<br>
<br>
when they know where they are going<br>
<br>
and they know when they will get there.<br>
<br>
<br>
they are happy to find a decently-sized flowerpot to plant themselves in
