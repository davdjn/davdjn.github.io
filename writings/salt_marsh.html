        I will choose to drown this year in the salt marsh;<br>
the sweet, clear streams I won't force myself upon,<br>
won't dirty with this windowless pathos. <br>
we can choose, always, the bodies we won't take to,<br>
the alms we will refuse, no matter how hungry we are,<br>
no matter how tasteful the praise may be.<br>
<br>
not in classrooms but continuity, will I walk the floors of the seas,<br>
never to be found by those loving lifeboats.
